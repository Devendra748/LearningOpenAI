## Create openApiKey
To generate an OpenAPI key, it is necessary to create an OpenAI account, proceed to the profile section, and then access the View API Keys option. Subsequently, it becomes possible to generate your own unique API key.

## get_completion() 
The function "get_completion" takes a prompt as input and utilizes the OpenAI API to generate a completion based on the specified model (default: gpt-3.5-turbo). The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the model's output. The function returns the content of the generated completion.
